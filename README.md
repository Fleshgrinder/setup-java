This is [actions/setup-java] with sensible defaults that can be changed globally, `.java-version` file support
(resolving [#113]), and automatic architecture mapping (resolving [#375]). I created this action, because I am not a
fan of copying and pasting things from one project to another, especially not when it comes to workflow automation.

## Usage

The example assumes that you have a `.java-version` file and are fine with the defaults:

```yaml
jobs:
  example:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest # All OS are supported!
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@main        # replace @main with desired version
    - uses: fleshgrinder/setup-java@main # replace @main with desired version
    - run: java -version                 # ðŸŽ‰
```

The version that was resolved is **always** exported as `JAVA_VERSION` to the environment. Subsequent steps can use it
to autoconfigure themselves (e.g. Gradle toolchain to use `JAVA_VERSION` if present, with a fallback to the checked in
`.java-version` file).

This action provides the ability to alter the defaults that have been chosen. This is especially useful for all users
of self-hosted runners. Simply include any of the following environment variables in your self-hosted runner to set the
default values for all your workflows:

| Variable                        | Description                                                                                                 |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `JAVA_DEFAULT_VERSION`          | Version to use if nothing else is present                                                                   |
| `JAVA_DEFAULT_VERSION_FILENAME` | Change the `.java-version` default                                                                          |
| `JAVA_DEFAULT_DISTRIBUTION`     | Change the `temurin` default                                                                                |
| `JAVA_DEFAULT_ARCHITECTURE`     | Disable the `$RUNNER_ARCH` mapping, can be used to add support for architectures that are not yet supported |
| `JAVA_DEFAULT_PACKAGE_TYPE`     | Change the `jdk` default                                                                                    |
| `JAVA_DEFAULT_CHECK_LATEST`     | Change the `false` default                                                                                  |
